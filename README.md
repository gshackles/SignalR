# Good News, Everyone!

This fork of SignalR is no longer maintained, as support for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android has been accepted into the [official SignalR repository](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR). I believe their current plan is to include this support as part of SignalR 2.0 (time frame unknown). In the meantime, you can use their [dev branch](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/tree/dev), which contains [my changes](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/pull/1585).
